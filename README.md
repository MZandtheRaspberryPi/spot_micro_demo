## Spot Micro Robot
This was a fun project where I 3d printed the robot, planned the hardware, assembled, and used a fellow robot builder's ROS Repo to get it walking. I contributed a bit to the robot builder's ROS repo as well. Check it out [here](https://github.com/MZandtheRaspberryPi/spot_micro_demo).
